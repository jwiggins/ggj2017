Modules:
* Type
* Health
* Modules (recursive. It's a tree)
* Attachment points
  - Deformable
  - Non-Deformable
* Resources generated
* Resistance to stress
  - Gravity
  - Temperature

Soil Moisture: 0 -> 100
Soil Nutrition: 0 -> 100
Light: Constant amount based on month
Temperature: min + range * season weather factor
Soil moisture adjustment: air moisture * current moisture
Soil nutrition adjustment: Simple cost per module grown
Energy:
  - Small amount provided by roots (just enough for leaves)
  - Larger amount provided by leaves
  - Leaf and Flower growth requires minimum Energy
  - Amount based on size of plant & soil moisture lost per turn
